**Folder with business logic only**. This directory doesn't care about _what database driver we are using_ or _which caching solution_

- `./app/controllers` folder for functional controllers (used in routes)
- `./app/models` folder for describe business models of the project
- `./app/queries` folder for describe queries for models of the project
